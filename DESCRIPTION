Description: Browser cookies are name-value pairs that are saved in a
    user's browser by a website. Cookies allow websites to persist
    information about the user and their use of the website. Here we
    provide tools for working with cookies in 'shiny' apps, in part by
    wrapping the 'js-cookie' JavaScript library
    <https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie>.
