\title{Parameters used in multiple functions}
\arguments{
\item{attributes}{A list with values for \code{expiration}, \code{secure_only},
\code{domain}, \code{path}, \code{same_site}, and \code{http_only}}

\item{cookie_name}{The name of the cookie. Can contain any US-ASCII
characters except for: the control character, space, a tab, or separator
characters like ( ) < > @ , ; : \\ " / [ ] ? = \{ \}.}

\item{cookie_value}{The contents of the cookie as a single character value.}

\item{domain}{The host to which the cookie will be sent (including
subdomains). If this is \code{NULL} (default) the cookie will only be sent to
the host of the page where this cookie was set (not including subdomains).}

\item{expiration}{Days after which the cookie should expire. To remove an
HttpOnly cookie, send a negative value for this attribute.}

\item{http_only}{Logical indicating whether the cookie should only be sent as
part of an HTTP request. When this is \code{FALSE} (default), the cookie is
accessible to JavaScript via the \code{Document.cookie} property.}

\item{path}{The path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to
send this cookie. Includes subdirectories.}

\item{same_site}{One of "strict", "lax" (default), or "none", indicating when
the cookie should be sent. When \code{same_site = "none"}, \code{secure_only} must be
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{secure_only}{Logical indicating whether the cookie should only be
accessible via secure (\verb{https:}) requests (except on localhost).}

\item{session}{Shiny session in which the cookies can be found (the default
should probably always be used).}

\item{ui}{A 0- or 1-argument function defining the ui of a shiny app, or a
\code{\link[shiny:reexports]{shiny::tagList()}}.}

These are parameters that are likely to show up in multiple functions, so I
gather their definitions in one easy-to-find place.
